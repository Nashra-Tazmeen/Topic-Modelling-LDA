Project Focus:
This notebook is dedicated to implementing Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) for coherence score calculation, serving as the primary objective of the project.

Dataset Selection:
The project utilizes a dataset comprising articles from the Medium platform, chosen specifically to facilitate the coherence score evaluation process.

Implementation Steps:
The implementation follows a systematic approach, starting with data preprocessing and moving on to LDA model training and evaluation.

Key Steps:

Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the Medium articles dataset for LDA analysis.
LDA Model Training: Utilizing the Gensim library to train the LDA model on the preprocessed dataset.
Coherence Score Calculation: Computing the coherence score to assess the quality and interpretability of the generated topics.
Result Analysis: Analyzing the coherence score results to draw insights and conclusions regarding the effectiveness of the LDA model.


Conclusion:
Through this project, the main aim is to evaluate the performance of the LDA model using coherence score as a metric. The findings and insights derived from this analysis contribute to a deeper understanding of topic modeling techniques and their applicability to real-world datasets.
